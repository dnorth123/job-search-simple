# URL Parsing Feature

## Overview
The job description upload component now supports three methods for parsing job descriptions:

1. **File Upload** - Upload job description files (TXT, MD, PDF, DOC, DOCX)
2. **URL Input** - Provide a URL to a job posting page (with auto-population)
3. **Text Paste** - Paste job description text directly

## URL Parsing Functionality

### How it Works
- Users can enter a URL to a job posting page
- The system attempts to fetch the HTML content from the URL
- The HTML is parsed to extract relevant text content
- **NEW**: When successful, the extracted text is automatically populated into the text input field
- Users can review and edit the extracted content before parsing
- The extracted text is then processed using the existing job description parser

### Auto-Population Feature
When URL parsing is successful:
- The extracted content is automatically pasted into the "Paste Text" field
- Users can review, edit, or add to the content before parsing
- A success message confirms the content has been extracted
- The URL input field is cleared for the next use
- Character count is displayed to show how much content was extracted

### Supported URL Types
- HTTP and HTTPS URLs only
- Job posting pages from various sources (LinkedIn, Indeed, company websites, etc.)
- Any webpage containing job description text

### Content Extraction
The system uses intelligent content extraction that:
- Removes navigation, headers, footers, and other non-content elements
- Focuses on job-specific content areas when possible
- Filters out common web page elements (cookies, privacy policies, etc.)
- Cleans up formatting and whitespace

### Error Handling
The system provides helpful error messages for common issues:
- **CORS Restrictions**: When websites block external requests
- **404 Errors**: When URLs are not found
- **403 Errors**: When access is forbidden
- **Invalid URLs**: When URL format is incorrect

### User Experience Improvements
- **Clear Button**: Users can clear the URL input field
- **Success Messages**: Clear feedback when content is extracted
- **Character Count**: Shows how much content was extracted
- **Auto-Clear**: URL field clears after successful extraction
- **Helpful Tips**: Guidance about URL parsing limitations

### Limitations
1. **CORS Restrictions**: Many websites block requests from external domains
2. **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript-rendered content may not be accessible
3. **Authentication**: Some job sites require login
4. **Rate Limiting**: Some sites may block frequent requests

### Fallback Options
When URL parsing fails, users are encouraged to:
1. Copy the job description text and paste it directly
2. Save the job posting as a file and upload it
3. Use browser extensions that can bypass CORS restrictions

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions
- `validateUrl(url: string)`: Validates URL format
- `extractTextFromUrl(url: string)`: Fetches and extracts text from URL
- `extractTextFromHtml(html: string)`: Parses HTML to extract relevant text

### Security Considerations
- Only HTTP/HTTPS protocols are allowed
- User-Agent headers are set to identify the bot
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- CORS restrictions are respected

### Future Enhancements
- Backend proxy service to handle CORS issues
- Support for more content types (JSON, XML)
- Better handling of dynamic content
- Integration with job board APIs
