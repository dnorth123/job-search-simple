# Issue Diagnosis & Quick Fixes

## üîß **Fixes Applied**

### ‚úÖ **1. LinkedIn API Key Configuration**
**Problem**: Rate limit error "API key not configured"
**Solution**: Fixed environment variable naming
- Changed: `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` ‚Üí `VITE_BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`
- Reason: Vite requires `VITE_` prefix for client-side environment variables

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **2. Character Limit in Company Field**
**Problem**: Can only type 2 characters in Company field
**Possible Causes**:
1. Browser autocomplete interfering
2. Form state conflict
3. CSS styling issue
4. JavaScript event handling problem

## üß™ **Quick Tests to Try**

### **Test 1: Refresh the Browser**
1. Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. Try typing in Company field again
3. **Expected**: Should work normally now

### **Test 2: Try Different Browser/Incognito**
1. Open incognito/private window
2. Go to http://localhost:5173/
3. Try Company field
4. **Expected**: Should work if it's a cache/extension issue

### **Test 3: Check for JavaScript Errors**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Clear all logs
4. Try typing in Company field
5. **Expected**: Should show any JavaScript errors

### **Test 4: Test LinkedIn Discovery**
1. Type "Microsoft" in Company field
2. Wait for LinkedIn discovery to appear
3. **Expected**: Should show LinkedIn suggestions or fallback options (no more rate limit error)

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

### **If Character Limit Persists**:

1. **Check input properties**:
   - Right-click Company field ‚Üí Inspect Element
   - Look for `maxlength` attribute in the HTML
   - Should NOT see any character limits

2. **Test with simple typing**:
   - Try typing very slowly
   - Try copying/pasting text
   - Try different characters (letters vs numbers)

3. **Check for form conflicts**:
   - Try typing in other form fields
   - See if the issue affects only the Company field

### **If LinkedIn Discovery Still Has Issues**:

1. **Check console for errors**:
   - Look for CORS errors (expected)
   - Look for authentication errors
   - Look for rate limiting errors (should be fixed)

2. **Verify API key**:
   - Check that `VITE_BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` appears in browser dev tools
   - Console ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage

## üéØ **Expected Current Behavior**

### **‚úÖ Working**:
- Company field accepts unlimited characters
- Job form submission works
- LinkedIn discovery component appears
- Rate limiting no longer blocks with "API key not configured"

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (due to CORS)**:
- LinkedIn search may show "service unavailable"
- Manual LinkedIn entry should still work
- Fallback mechanisms should activate

### **‚ùå Should be Fixed**:
- ~~"Rate limit exceeded: API key not configured"~~
- ~~Character limit in Company field~~ (if refresh helps)

## üöÄ **Testing Protocol**

1. **Refresh browser** (important after env changes)
2. **Try typing "Microsoft Corporation" in Company field**
3. **Expected**: Full text should be accepted
4. **Wait for LinkedIn discovery to trigger**
5. **Expected**: Either suggestions or graceful fallback

**Next Steps**: 
- Try the quick tests above
- Report which ones work/don't work
- Check browser console for any new errors
